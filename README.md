# sokoban

Clojure app for playing sokoban.
Based on [RubyQuiz](http://www.rubyquiz.com/quiz5.html) and [The Caves of Clojure](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/07/caves-of-clojure-01/)

## Usage

* Correct scrolling of a long level list
* Unclear positioning scheme, levels are drawn in one way and text in another - should be improved
