# sokoban of the dead

You wake up at the cemetery. It's getting dark, and all of the tombstones are moved.
Zombies start to raise from their graves. You must put tombstones back, or... Brainzzzzzz...

Clojure app for playing sokoban.
Inspired by the [RubyQuiz](http://www.rubyquiz.com/quiz5.html) and based on the [The Caves of Clojure](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/07/caves-of-clojure-01/).

## Usage

Place your own levels into the "levels" directory. Both single level files and collections (.slc) files are accepted.

j/k to select level

h/j/k/l to move
r to restart
q to return to the level selection
escape to exit

## Future work

* Add undo/redo
* Add splash screen
* Add backstory
* Unclear positioning scheme, levels are drawn in one way and text in another - should be improved
