# sokoban

Clojure app for playing sokoban.
Based on [RubyQuiz](http://www.rubyquiz.com/quiz5.html) and [The Caves of Clojure](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/07/caves-of-clojure-01/)

## Usage

h/j/k/k to move
r to restart
escape to exit

## Future work

* Add undo/redo
* Add splash screen
* Add backstory
* Add level collection parsing
** Correct scrolling of a long level list
* Unclear positioning scheme - should be improved
* Use lanterna/move-cursor for level selection
